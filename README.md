Data and metadata used for <b>material prediction</b> and <b>multi-view retrieval</b> experiments can be found on the primary dataset [website](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). Data, metadata and code used for <b>single-view 3D reconstruction</b> experiments can be found here.

## Download 3D renders dataset
The rendered ABO images + camera poses for 3D reconstruction benchmarking can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1clvbjzblsM2gdRUui14VGYcuG1sEuCAf/view?usp=sharing) (223 GB). The dataset contains Blender renderings of 30 viewpoints for each of the 7,953 3D objects in ABO, as well as camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each rendering.
